## Bio
I am 18 and non-binary (they/them).</br>

I develop whatever I choose, tending to forget to upload to GitHub unless I actually need to transfer it to another PC without USB drives or any other trouble. Projects are for me spitballing ideas, might contain code fragments for features I want to add into certin repositories. Think of them as open idea boards for thoughts and plans in my head for things that may or may not come true.</br>

#### Other Facts
I am a photographer as well as a musician, with a strong interest in game development as a hobby. I play Beat Saber pseudo-competitively, playing for leaderboard positions rather than in genuine tournaments or events.[^1]

## Naming Conventions
Certain repositories have prefixes that can be used to determine what they are for. Here's a list:
1. `HMAD` - Repository for Honours Mobile App Development, my current high school course.

## Education
Graduated from Abington Heights High School (PA). 2023.</br>
Current computer science student at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. 2027.
