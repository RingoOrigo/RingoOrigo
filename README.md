## Bio
Ringo Origo is a sixteen-year-old programmer who mostly works with Java at an intermediate/advanced level for personal projects, but Python at a novice level in regards to creating Discord bots. From a young age, Ringo had always been interested in computers, with his new fixation being within Virtual Reality and how it can be utilized for gaming. Many repositories created are rarely maintained at the current moment due to a lack of free time.
